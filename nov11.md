- Overriding vs. Overloading
	- Overloading: Different parameter list
	- Overriding: Same parameter list, replace the other method COMPLETELY
- Subclasses DO NOT inherit private members of a class
- A subclass can only have one super class
- Abstraction means user of class does not need to know how class is implemented. Details of implementation are encapsulated and hidden from user
- Cannot override static methods
- Inherited by subclasses:
	- public static, protected static
- Data Encapsulation - Hiding data from other classes
