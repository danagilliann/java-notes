### Include the ff in cheat sheet (Hi companies I'm not actually cheating I'm allowed to bring a cheat sheat):
- Overflow/Underflow
- Coercing
- Import statements
- Alphabet shit (Hi Alphabet u rock)
- Hex and decimal
- [Primative Data Types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
- Math.random() [0,1)
- Insertion sort

### Arrayzzz
- To change array things
```
// This thing will change the array values to {11, 22, 33}
int[] a = {1,2,3};

public static void pa(int[] param) {
	for (int i=0; i < param.length; ++i) { 
		param[i] = param[i] * 11;
	}
}
```
- Array contents are actually memory address. That memory address points to a location of a place in memory
- When you copy an array, you're making a new memory address in a new array. But both the old array and new array point to the same position in memory

### Selection Sort
- Outer loop: Loop through length of array
- Inner loop: Comparing the current index with other numbers in the loop
- Swap happens in the outer loop

### Pop Quiz Notes
- Can have a return statement in void
- Length: # of things in the list
- Index: Position in the list
- Method overloading: Having two methods with the same name
- between 'a' and 'z'
- Pass by value --> Passing stuff to params
- Compiler: Checks syntax
- When redeclaring list length, default values of old version of array gets overwritten
- GEMDAS applies to operators
