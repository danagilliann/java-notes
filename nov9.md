### Inheritance
- Define new classes from existing classes
- Possible for subclasses to override superclass use the direction `@Override` to show that it's an overwritten class
	- Subclasses can override from any superclass
	- If override without `@Override` it'll be fine (it's just better practice to do this)
- `protected` private for all except subclasses
- `super` 
	- To invoke superclass methods and objects (similar to using `this`)
	- Can be used to called constructors
- `Math.random()` --> [0,1)
